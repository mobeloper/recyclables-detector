Detect recyclables using CircularNet model by google


The model is built using Mask R-CNN, Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks, which is a deep learning model for instance image segmentation, where the goal is to assign instance level labels (e.g. person1, person2, cat) to every pixel in an input image.
